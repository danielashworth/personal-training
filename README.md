# Spring personal training repository
This repository is for learning about and experimenting with Spring features as part of
my ongoing development.

Most of the concepts I explored came from watching talks on the
[SpringDeveloper](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpringSourceDev)
YouTube channel.

## Modules
The project is split into different modules each with their own
`src` and `pom.xml` files. Each module relates to a specific spring feature
or concept I was interested in exploring.

A master `pom.xml` file exists on project root which contains common dependencies
for all modules.
